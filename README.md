# OOP
java Object-Oriented Programming Project

Overview:

Our project revolves around the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. The project aims to demonstrate how to use objects, classes, and the four pillars of object-oriented programming (inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction) to build a robust and organized application.

Features:

Structural Organization: Using classes to organize and modularize components and functions systematically.
Code Reusability: Facilitating code reusability by utilizing classes and object-oriented principles.
Simplified Development: Streamlining development processes and maintenance using object-oriented concepts.

Example of Object-Oriented Programming:

In this project, we utilize classes to represent various types of vehicles such as cars and bikes. Inheritance is used to derive subclasses from base classes, and composition is used to link vehicle components. Polymorphism is showcased by employing different functions for the vehicles, and abstraction is implemented to generalize common properties and behaviors.
